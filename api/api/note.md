<!-- what do you think about implementing crud in on page ?
here is my idea :
create a table to list data without the action th.
to create :
there will be a last row where there will be the inputs and just after the tr a submit button.
to update to delete :
double click or a row show 2 buttons (update , delete) :
the update button :
transform the table data into input that can be modified to update it. and 2 button will appear ( submit, cancel) .
the delete button :
show 2 buttons ( confirm, cancel ) . -->
